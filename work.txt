We need to prepare the app for deployment to Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend).

1. Add a railway.json file in the root of the project:
{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "cd backend && uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health"
  }
}

2. Add a /health endpoint to FastAPI that returns {"status": "ok"}

3. Add vercel.json in the root:
{
  "buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "frontend/dist",
  "rewrites": [{"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html"}]
}

4. Frontend must use VITE_API_URL environment variable for all API calls instead of hardcoded localhost:8000

5. Add CORS to FastAPI to allow all origins for now (we can restrict later)

6. Make sure requirements.txt is complete and up to date
